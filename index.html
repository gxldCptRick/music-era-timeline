                <p class="cap"> Hildegard von Bingen also known as saint hildegard and sibyl of the rhine was a german nun and also considered the founder of the scientific natural history, the research and study of organisms, in germany. She was born around the year 1098, although an exact date is uncertain. Hildegard was having visions from an early age and thus was given to the church by her parents. While serving in the church she was writing church music and wrote many songs including Alleluia, o virga mediatrix. Hildegard von Bingen died the 17th of september in 1179. </p>

                    Alleluia, o virga mediatrix was a monophonic piece that was gregorian chant in the Choral Music Genre and has no rhythm because of the time it was created composers were not thinking of music in that kind of detail let alone the fact that they only had a limited way to be able to express their musical ideas.

He was a part of the musical movement known as the ars nova or “new art” and that lead into better notation of the musical arts and thus more control over the way the music would sound to the composer. One of the songs that machaut wrote for the ars nova was Ma fin est mon commencement.</p>
